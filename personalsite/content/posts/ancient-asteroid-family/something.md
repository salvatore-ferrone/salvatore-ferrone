## Who, what, when, and where?
I am [Salvatore Ferrone](), a PhD student at l'Observatoire de Paris, the first author of the paper, and the author of this blog. This blog discusses a scientific paper about asteroids in the main belt of the solar system that is being published in te European journal [Astronomy & Astrophysics](). This work was initiated during a 2021 summer internship under professor Marco Delbo at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. This was between first and second years of my master's degree. I continued this work for my master's project in the spring of 2022, and finalized it during a second contract between my masters and PhD in the summer of 2022. The paper was submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics in the fall of 2022, and was accepted for publication on 22 May 2023 after peer review.

The co-authors of this paper are:
* [Marco Delbò](https://www.oca.eu/en/marco-delbo): 
    - My supervisor, and the person who initiated this project. He is a professor at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. He is an expert in asteroid families, and has been working on them for over 20 years. 
* [Alessandro Morbidelli](https://www.oca.eu/en/alessandro-morbidelli)
    - Alessandro is a professor at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. He is an expert in the formation and evolution of the solar system, and has been working on it for over 20 years.
* [Chrysa Avdellidou](https://www.oca.eu/en/chrysa-avdellidou) 
    - Chrysa is a post-doctoral researcher at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. She is an expert in the formation and evolution of the solar system, and has been working on it for over 10 years.
* [Kevin Walsh](https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~kwalsh/cv.html)
    - Kevin is a senior scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, USA. He is an expert in the formation and evolution of the solar system, and has been working on it for over 20 years.
* [Rogerio Deienno](https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~rdeienno/)
    - Rogerio is a post-doctoral researcher at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. He is an expert in the formation and evolution of the solar system, and has been working on it for over 10 years.
* [Robert Melikyan](https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/graduate/students/robert-melikyan)
    - PhD student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Working in catestrophic disruption of asteroids and the subsequent formation of asteroid families.

### Why?
This blog is written in support of the publication submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics. I wanted to add more detail to the paper and provide a more in-depth explanation of the methods used to identify the family, and make the work more understandable for someone unfamiliar with the literature. 

### How? 
This blog was written using Markdown, and the website was built using Hugo. The theme used is [Hugo Blog Awesome](https://hugo-blog-awesome.netlify.app/). The research was done with much dedication and time!

### How do we detect asteroid families?
    - how does the HCM work?
    - show was zappalà did. (shuffling proper elements)
    - the problem with knowing what a family-less background looks like. 


### What are proper elements?
    - show the graph of proper elements versus keplerian elements
    - reference morbidelli's book. Computing them is compicated and involves a hamiltontian formalism, it would probably require a couple months of serious studying with a textbook. However, they are easy to understand. Refernce the data base that computes

## What is the current state of the before this work?
    - Essentially, Nesvorny et al is the seminal work. 
    - Show some plots from this work.

## What has changed since 2015? 
    - More and more implementation of the Yarkovsky effect to characterize the families.
    - Show delbò and bolin and Walsh and Deienno papers. 

## What is the Yarkovsky effect?
    - show the graph of proper elements versus keplerian elements

## Methods

### Fitlering the data set

### Removing the known families

- New contribution, combining the yarkovsky and the proper elements to identify the families.
- Parameters:
    - We take some things that already exist
        - We take the reference background 
    - 
    - We shuffle the diameters of the asteroids. 
    -
