## Introduction

Some images here describing the base concepts 
* What is the Galaxy?
* What are globular clusters?
    * globular cluster fun facts

{{< youtube id="oIBfR6xnl4I" >}}

* What are the tidal forces?

{{< youtube id="Bxt-yz8ABIc" >}}

* what are tidal streams?
    * History of tidal streams 
        * Palomar 5 being discovered 20 years ago
        * mostly with color magnitude information and limited spatial information
    * tidal streams in the era of Gaia
        * Ibata et al using bayesian statistics to discover many more streams today since we have more from Gaia. 


## The Literature 
* what existed in the literature before the project?
    * Modeling streams one at a time
    * associating some streams to globular clusters
    * using streams to constrain potential parameters of host galaxies using a bayesian approach 


## The project's goals
* To model the production of stellar streams from all milkway globular clusters

### Simulation showing many streams being made from many globular clusters
