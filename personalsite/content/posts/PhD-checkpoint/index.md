## PhD Checkpoint #1

To Dr. Gary Mamon and Dr. Françoise Combes, thank you for taking your time out to check in my progress. I hope that you will find my work satisfactory and can cretique it freely in the aims of forming a better scientist. To Dr. Paola Di Matteo, thank you for directing me and providing me with an opprotunity to make a valid contribution in astronomy. To Dr. Marco Montouri, I look forward to working together more closely when I arrive in Rome. I would also like to thank other professors and professionals who have helped such as Nicolas Lecleric, Rodrigo Ibata, and Vanessa Hill, Clément Hottier, Owain Snaith, Sergy Kohpersnov, Misha Haywood, and David Vallas Gaubaund. Additionally, I would like to thank the other junior researchers within and outside of our group such as Gulia Pagnini, Valeria Cerqui, Andre Saccardi, Jessie Palmerio, Laia Casa, and Sofia Bisero, Eliot Stien, and Antoine Fort.

## Les courants stellaires pour l'archéologie galactique et cosmique : quand la gravité rencontre la complexité
(Stellar streams for Galactic and cosmic archaeology: when gravity meets complexity)

### Problematique (problem statement)
Avec ce projet de thèse, nous souhaitons 1) modeliser les courants stellaires autour de tous les amas globulaires de la Galaxie, en utilisant une variété de potentiels galactiques, incluant ou non les perturbations dues à la barre, aux nuages moléculaires géants, aux autres amas globulaires passant à proximité, et aux sous-structures de matière noire ; 2) développer et utiliser un ensemble de méthodes statistiques pour comparer les différentes simulations, en quantifiant les différences et les similitudes entre les caractéristiques des courants formés dans différents potentiels. Le but du projet est de caracteriser les signatures que de differentes structures visibles et de matière noire laissent dans la morfologie et cinématique des courants stellaires, pour pouvoir interpreter la grande quantité de nouvelles decouvertes faites en analysant les données de la mission astrometrique Gaia. Qu'est-ce-que les courants stellaires autour des amas globulaires peuvent nous reveler sur la distribution de la matière baryonique et de la matière noire dans notre Galaxie et sur leur granularité ?

### Thématique 
Among the variety of systems found in our Galaxy, there are some, very old, which have been capturing the attention of astronomers for more than a century. These systems, which are called globular clusters because of their round shape, are collections of hundreds of thousands up to millions of stars, bound together by gravity. Globular clusters can be as old as the Universe itself (about 13.7 billion years), and as such they have been orbiting the Galaxy for several billion years, keeping key information about Galactic evolution through cosmic times.


### Domaine
One of the main processes affecting the globular cluster population, its evolution in number, masses and sizes with time, is tidal stripping. The long-term effect of this process consists of stripping the system of its most loosely bound stars, which redistribute themselves onto orbits similar to that of their progenitor, forming so-called ``tidal tails'' or streams around it.

### Objectif
The objective of the thesis is to:

1. build comprehensive catalogues of simulated stellar currents around globular clusters in a variety of Galactic potentials, including and excluding perturbations due to the bar, giant molecular clouds, other nearby globular clusters, and dark matter substructures;
2. develop and use a set of statistical methods to compare the different catalogues, quantifying the differences and similarities between the characteristics of the recovered currents in different potentials and their statistical significance, also taking into account the uncertainties in the knowledge of the current positions and velocities of globular clusters in the Milky Way.

A complete census of these stellar currents is currently lacking. However, this is a fundamental step, both to support the search for new streams in the data, and to quantify the extent to which different assumptions in the way we model the distribution of visible and dark matter mass can affect the properties of the overall system of stellar streams.

### Contexte
The context of this project is the study of our Galaxy, in the context of the ESA Gaia astrometric mission and the complementary spectroscopic surveys that will soon be operational (WEAVE, MOONS).

### Méthodologie
The aim will be to develop a set of numerical simulations of the formation of stellar streams in different galactic potentials and to use/develop the most appropriate statistical methods for their analysis. The numerical code for stellar stream simulations is already available in our group. This PhD project will allow the student to acquire a wide range of scientific knowledge and technical skills: from galactic dynamics, stellar populations and cosmology at Galactic scales to statistical methods for astrophysics; from the complete chain of the design, initialization and execution of large numerical simulations on national supercomputers to the most efficient ways of processing and analysing these data sets. Finally, we plan to make the simulations developed during this PhD project available to the community on a dedicated website. All this should ensure that the student is trained in a number of scientific and technical skills, which will be an asset for his future.


## Une année après d'avoir déposé la candidature

### What have I done? 
Zero-ith-ly, I have created this website in recent days in an attempt to share my science faster, more easily, such that I can always demonstrate my work to someone as long as there is internet!

First, two birds one stone, to add more context to the thesis as well as demonstrate a deliverable, I have create many animations and mastered a process to make them easily. Previously, I was using `Matplotlib`'s animation package. This is penible. Now I use `ffmpeg` which is much faster and easier and allows for much more control.

#### A Globular Cluster That Orbits a Galaxy
This is a simulation of Palomar 5, in the aims to be a demonstration of the growth of tidal tails. 1000 particles were used. These particles experience the potential from the Milky Way and a time-static Plummer Potential, as explained in the paper.

#### Most of the Globular Clusters in the Milky Way
One globular cluster is pleasent, The same one in the Galaxy is cool, what about using about 100 globular clusters? This animation shows just that. It uses 1000 particles per GC, compared to 100,000 particles as in our paper. The POV is from the sun's position today. The center of the screen points towards the galactic center, the sides are behind us. Thus, this is galaxtic coordiantes. There is an element of depth in this presentation since I scaled the size particles by their distance from the sun.

### Deliverables

#### Presentations  

For a complete list of presentations, see the [presentations]({{< relref "/pages/Publications.md" >}}) section below. I have published two first authors papers since the begining of the PhD. I am a co-author on a paper of Dr. Laia Casamiquela. I am a co-author on another paper that is soon to be published by Dr. Jules Bourdelles de Micas. Additionally, I making a contribution to a paper with Dr. Rodrigo Ibata of Strasbourg. 

**EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS STILL SCRAP.**

## INTENDED FUTURE PROJECTED

- Adding context to infering progenitor orbits from streams
   - we were looking for a type of correction, or searching for a systematic predictor that could inform us how to fix a stream to obtain the orbit. 
      - to do that, I looked to [Varghese et al 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19097.x) as a guide and tried to reproduce their results.

Varghese's method for quick computational inference

Step (1) create a fiducial model using a self-consistent nbody computation

Step (2) now reproduce the stream by following the progenitor orbit in the fiducial model, but using particle spray:
