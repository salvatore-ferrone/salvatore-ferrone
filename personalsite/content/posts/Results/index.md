After implementing the methods defined in the previous section, we select some principal results and display them here

What are the important things to say? that we have a prediction of the tidal debris coming from all galactic globular clusters. We present the results in three different ways:
A global view.  this includes looking at all of the debris as well as viewing them in distance from the center. 

We can present them one at a time, show the different types of morphologies

we can compare the model results to observations. 

For each of these, we also have the 6D phase space information, and we also compare the different models. 

Lastly, all of these data are publicly available. 


## All Tidal Debris

First, here is a video color coating all tidal debris based on the progenitor. This uses the PII gravitational model of the Milky Way.

Next, we can now color this map based on the number density and see the overall differences between the net properties of stars stripped from Globular Clusters.
