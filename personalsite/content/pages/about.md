# Current status

My name is Salvatore Ferrone. I am a PhD student at the l'Observatoire de Paris, France. My PhD is split between l'observatoire de Paris and La Sapienza in Rome. I am interested in the dynamics stars emerging from Globular Clusters within the Milky Way. 

# Previous Research Experience 
For my master's thesis I discovered an ancient asteroid family in the main belt and published an article. Before this, I worked on the OSIRIS-REx mission analyzing visible-infrared spectra of one asteroid, 101955-Bennu, which was the missions target. 


# NOTE. The website is a work in progress 

### Why build and publish an unfinished website?

My main motivators for creating this site are to share my research projects more easily and to initiate the writing of my thesis. I am hoping that by putting my work out there, more people can understand it and critique my writing such that it will be better when I submit the thesis. Another objective is to be able to re-use my material for presentations with ease as well as benefit from all the material tha the internet has to offer just by adding a link to a published video or image. I want to try and use this website to share my work, be it to someone on my phone who is a non-expert in astronomy or to international conferences to people that are 40 years my senior. 

Of course, I am aware of all the pitfalls of doing this. Perhaps my idealistic vision of recycling material with ease will never come true, perhaps it will be more difficult than using power points! Maybe I'll never find a good way to present my material so that expects and amateurs can understand. Maybe professors at conferences that are potential employers for post-docs will dislike my unorthodox approach and not want to hire me. Maybe they'll think that I'm writing a website out of laziness! Little do they know, its quite the opposite. Nonetheless, I think the pros outweigh the cons. Beyond that, for someone with no prior web-development, I find the challenge stimulating. Additionally, I have to prove to myself that I'm not making a website out of laziness. Additionally, I have to prove to myself that by using as a conference tool, I'm not avoiding doing something because of fear of what others think. After all, maybe they'll like and we can start building researcher websites together. Hugo and GitHub are making it quite accessible, and our research should be viewed as a public good, therefore I see it as *necessary* to make my research as accessible as possible to everyone. 

# My dream for this website:

There are several changes I would like to make to this website before being satisfied. First, is that I would like to create a series of pages under the category of *Thesis*. So far, template automatically parses them by date. So to combat this, I put the dates of all my intended thesis chapters under my birth year *1996*. Otherwise, there are some other pages that serve as bit as blog posts. There is a presentation that I made for the l'Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, this is supposed to be in support of the publication for my Master's thesis. Additionally, I have another post that I used for my *comité de suivi de thèse* (thesis committee) to show them what I have done since starting. I found this to be a success since can access the site at anytime to review what I presented. I hope it helped them write their report. 

Additionally, I would like to have a couple other blogs about random topics that interest me. I would also like to write some of these blogs in Italian and French. To do that I'll have to work a bit closer with another developer or spend hours online reading Hugo documentation! We will see what happens.
