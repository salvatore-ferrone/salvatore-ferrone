My name is Salvatore Ferrone. I am a PhD student at the l'Observatoire de Paris, France. I am interested in the dynamics stars emergining from Globular Clusters within the Milky Way. Previous, I have worked on the dynamics of asteroids in the Solar System as visible and infrared data analysis to support NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission.
