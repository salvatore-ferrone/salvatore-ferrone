### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**salvatore-ferrone/salvatore-ferrone** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...

-->

when testing the website locally do:
``` bash
hugo server
```

then, when you want to send the code to the server do:
``` bash
cd ./salvatore-ferrone/personalsite/public
hugo -t hugo-blog-awesome
git remote -v  
git status
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin main 
```

the command:
```
hugo -t hugo-blog-awesome
```
Creates all of the static assets and puts them in the public folder.
I made the public folder a submodle of the `salvatore-ferrone.github.io` repository. Thus, when within this folder, when we push to the main brain, we are pushing to the main branch of the submodule: `salvatore-ferrone.github.io`.

The static assets get updated immediately and the website should be updated instantaneously.
